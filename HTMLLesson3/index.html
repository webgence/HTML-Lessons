     <h1> What are the three different types of pictures? </h1>
     <p> PNG is an image file that has an image that usally has color. An JPEG is also an image file that could be adjusted and edited. An GIF has animation or movement.</p>

     <h1> PNG </h1>
     <p> PNG or portable network graphics is a raster-graphics file-format that supports lossless data compression. PNG was developed as an improved, non-patented replacement for Graphics Interchange Format. PNG supports palette-based images, grayscale images, and full-color non-palette-based RGB/RGBA images.</p>

     <h1> JPEG </h1>
     <p> JPEG is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality.</p>

     <h1> GIF </h1>
     <p> The Graphics Interchange Format, is a bitmap image format that was developed by a team at the online services provider CompuServe. Gif have animation or movements. </p>
